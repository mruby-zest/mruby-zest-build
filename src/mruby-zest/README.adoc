MRuby-Zest
----------

This repository contains all of the widgets needed to create the 
'zyn-fusion' user interface for ZynAddSubFX.
The .qml files are *not* Qt's QML, but they borrow the syntax and use a
set of ruby libraries to run them (mruby-qml-parse/mruby-qml-spawn/mruby-nanovg).

This library is available under the LGPLv2+ license.
